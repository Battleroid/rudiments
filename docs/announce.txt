The 0.2.1 release primarily adds Sphinx documentation and the new module
``humanize`` for I/O of common values in forms understood by humans, e.g.
byte sizes in IEC notation.

The 'rudiments' package collects ‘miscellaneous’ functionality that is
unspecific in nature and shared among many projects. It also provides
small extensions to other support packages that don't warrant their own
project, in the rudiments.reamed package.
