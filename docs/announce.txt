The 0.3.0 release adds the ``security`` module, which for now encapsulates
retrieving credentials for accessing secured URLs from various sources
(keyring, netrc, terminal prompts).

The 'rudiments' package collects ‘miscellaneous’ functionality that is
unspecific in nature and shared among many projects. It also provides
small extensions to other support packages that don't warrant their own
project, in the rudiments.reamed package.
